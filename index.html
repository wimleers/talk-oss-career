							Drupal 6 had an optional "update statistics" module. You had to manually install it. Drupal 7 included it. So: finally fairly accurate usage statistics!<br>
							Note how Drupal 6 usage went from 25K in June 2008 to 100K in December, to 200K in October 2009, to 300K mid 2010. Then it started to plateau, because Drupal 7 was around the corner. Then in June 2011, when important modules were ported, Drupal 8 started to take off even faster. From 25K to 300K in a year.</p>

							Many people grew or even built their careers on Drupal! Because those hundreds of thousands of sites of course need to be built, maintained and supported. Plus, lessons are learned that must be applied to the next Drupal version.
							<br>
							People leave, people come. New contributors are stepping up all the time. Others leave, and go on to do great things elsewhere. Interests change, lives change, people change. But they left with more insights, more knowledge.

							Contributing to OSS, whether it's through code or peer reviews, constructive discussions or writing tests to make problems easier to reproduce… it all adds up to very valuable experience. The sort of experience you will need in your job anyway.
							<br>So, contributing to OSS during your student years means you'll get a better job to start in (the more interesting job, or the better paying job, or both), and you'll be better at it sooner than those who did not contribute to OSS, because you've already got more experience!

				3. My story
				 - student at UHasselt
				 - stumbled upon Drupal for an organization I was involved with
				 - tried Drupal, wanted to development a key missing component
				 - in doing so, found others who wanted this, they wanted to sponsor development
				 - went to my first conference/my first flight, all by myself, not knowing anybody — a great experience
				 - freelance! Much better than crappy summer jobs. Earn more, learn more.
				 - frustrated by slow sites
				 - bachelor thesis on web performance + Drupal
				 - course on data mining at UHaselt
				 - master thesis on data mining + performance
				 - contacted by Facebook for a job
				 - internship instead please?
				 - Facebook internship, successfully completed
				 - work at Acquia, a start-up centered on Drupal, working as a right hand for the CTO, started as “senior”

							I started studying in 2006, and graduated in 2011. Some of these things I learned along the way — outside of the classroom. Others I only learned later. I was thoroughly frightened of math, worked hard, and managed to pass them.
							<br>In December 2006, I started using Drupal. 10 years later, I'm still contributing :) Bachelor thesis on making Drupal faster by using CDNs. Master thesis on using data mining for web performance optimization.
							<br>In the fall of 2011, I did an internship at Facebook in Silicon Valley, as the internship in the last year of CS. I got it thanks to my blogging about my bachelor &amp; master theses.
							<br>In May 2012, I joined Acquia, a Drupal-based start-up, working remotely from Belgium.

							My involvement in the Drupal community plus my impatience led to me blogging about how to make Drupal pages load faster. I did my bachelor thesis about integrating Drupal with CDNs. And then I did my master thesis about data mining applied on web performance data, to automatically pinpoint root causes, allowing developers to just focus on optimizing.
							<br>To my surprise, my blogging about those things led to Facebook contacting me 😮. I first thought it was elaborate spam — but it was real! The first interview didn't go to well. I re-read the "Algorithms &amp; Data Structures" course, and the second one went great!

							I first took a risk — I went to DrupalCon Barcelona without really knowing what to expect. About 400 people there, had a great time. Paid my own way. Also went to DC Szeged paying for it myself. Then the DC in DC was the first one to have scholarships for students. My first time in the United States!
							<br>Later on, as I started working for Acquia, I got to go to many more DrupalCons as part of my job. Thanks to these DrupalCons, I — an introvert 😰 — now have friends all over the world.

							I used to be afraid to talk in front of more than 2 people. Presenting in front of a classroom was hell. Slowly I gained the confidence to stand before people at a DrupalCon. First consciously to get out of my comfort zone. Then for my job — first hesitantly, but now with ease. I still can't believe it.

				 - peer review (includes technical discussions, presenting arguments … — making a case)
				 - consequences of more features
				 - consequences of technical debt
				 - consequences of technical wealth
				 - consequences of adoption
				 - the pros and cons of freelancing: pricing, ensuring stream of clients, more control over taxes, freedom

							At Acquia, I work in the Office of the CTO. This means I work as one of several "right hands" of the CTO — which is that same guy you saw earlier, Dries Buytaert, in his dorm room, where he started Drupal. I work full time on the open source project. When Drupal grows, Acquia grows. So Acquia is one of the biggest sponsors of the Drupal project. But there are many, many more companies that contribute back, and even more individuals. Drupal 8 was built by over 3000 individuals! That puts it in the same league as the Linux kernel — it's one of the biggest open source projects in existence!

							These are some of the companies that rely on Acquia for their web experience. What Acquia does, is offer rock-solid hosting plus around-the-clock support. We host mission-critical Drupal-based sites. We guarantee success: that your webshop never goes offline, that your real-time information boards are always online, and so on. We are proactive: we work to prevent problems you may encounter. And the pain points that we see multiple times, those we fix in Drupal itself: that information helps inform what improvements we should make to the next version of Drupal.

							For me, I've gotten satisfaction (code that is actually used), happiness (great experiences, making new friends) and a great alternative to summer jobs out of contributing to OSS. Later, that resulted in a remote Drupal job, allowing me to work from Belgium with awesome colleagues spread 9 timezones apart. A job that is paid much better than most programming jobs in Belgium.
							<br>At the same time, I do not get the typical company car … which I don't mind, because I don't have to sit in traffic jams every single day to go check into the same office building every damn day for the same mind-numbing 7.36 hours of sitting at a desk, like many Belgians.
