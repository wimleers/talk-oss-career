							<p>Drupal 6 had an optional "update statistics" module. You had to manually install it. Drupal 7 included it. So: finally fairly accurate usage statistics!</p>
							<p>Note how Drupal 6 usage went from 25K in June 2008 to 100K in December, to 200K in October 2009, to 300K mid 2010. Then it started to plateau, because Drupal 7 was around the corner. Then in June 2011, when important modules were ported, Drupal 8 started to take off even faster. From 25K to 300K in a year.</p>

				3. My story
				 - student at UHasselt
				 - stumbled upon Drupal for an organization I was involved with
				 - tried Drupal, wanted to development a key missing component
				 - in doing so, found others who wanted this, they wanted to sponsor development
				 - went to my first conference/my first flight, all by myself, not knowing anybody — a great experience
				 - freelance! Much better than crappy summer jobs. Earn more, learn more.
				 - frustrated by slow sites
				 - bachelor thesis on web performance + Drupal
				 - course on data mining at UHaselt
				 - master thesis on data mining + performance
				 - contacted by Facebook for a job
				 - internship instead please?
				 - Facebook internship, successfully completed
				 - work at Acquia, a start-up centered on Drupal, working as a right hand for the CTO, started as “senior”

								<li>I started studying in 2006, and graduated in 2011. Some of these things I learned along the way — outside of the classroom. Others I only learned later.
								<li>In December 2006, I started using Drupal. 10 years later, I'm still contributing :) Bachelor thesis on making Drupal faster by using CDNs. Master thesis on using data mining for web performance optimization.
								<li>In the fall of 2011, I did an internship at Facebook in Silicon Valley, as the internship in the last year of CS. I got it thanks to my blogging about my bachelor &amp; master theses.

				4. Learned along the way
				 - VCS vs project.zip → project2.zip → projectFINAL.zip → projectFINALforRealz.zip
				 - peer review (includes technical discussions, presenting arguments … — making a case)
				 - consequences of more features
				 - consequences of technical debt
				 - consequences of technical wealth
				 - consequences of adoption
				 - the pros and cons of freelancing: pricing, ensuring stream of clients, more control over taxes, freedom
				 - pricing: selling yourself too cheap
				 - a better sense of how the world/economy/business works

							At Acquia, I work in the Office of the CTO. This means I work as one of several "right hands" of the CTO — which is that same guy you saw earlier, Dries Buytaert, in his dorm room, where he started Drupal. I work full time on the open source project. When Drupal grows, Acquia grows. So Acquia is one of the biggest sponsors of the Drupal project. But there are many, many more!
